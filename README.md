# ACME Business & Operations Analysis Report

## Overview
This project was created to analyze the business performance of ACME Company using spoofed data. The goal was to identify key insights into sales trends, product performance, customer preferences, and operational efficiency. The findings provide actionable recommendations to optimize ACMEâ€™s business strategy.

## Data Collection
The data used in this project was **spoofed** to simulate realistic business operations. The dataset includes:
- Sales transactions (2020-2024)
- Customer reviews and ratings
- Inventory levels and warehouse distributions
- Payment methods used by customers

The data was structured to reflect actual business conditions and analyzed using **SQL queries** to extract key insights. SQL was used within **Excel** to import data, and all visualization and analysis were then conducted in **Excel**.

## Data Cleaning
To ensure data quality and consistency, the following steps were performed:
1. **Handling Missing Data**
   - Missing values in product sales were assumed to be `0` where applicable.
   - Customer ratings without reviews were removed to maintain integrity.

2. **Data Transformation**
   - Applied **logarithmic transformation** to prevent negative sales projections.
   - Aggregated sales and revenue data by region, product, and time period.

3. **Error Checking**
   - Duplicates were removed to prevent skewed analysis.
   - Ensured proper relational integrity between sales, inventory, and payment records.

This project demonstrates **data-driven decision-making** and provides insights that can be used in real-world business strategy formulation.

### Next Steps
- Implement an interactive **Tableau dashboard** for real-time business insights.
- Expand analysis to include **profitability metrics and cost optimizations**.
- Integrate external datasets (e.g., competitor pricing) for deeper insights.
